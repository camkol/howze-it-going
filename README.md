### Links

- Live Site URL: [View](https://accordion-component2.netlify.app/)

## My process

- The `App` component renders an `Accordion` component and passes an array of FAQ data as props.
- The `Accordion` component iterates over the FAQ data array and renders an `AccordionItem` component for each FAQ entry.
- Each `AccordionItem` component represents an FAQ item and manages its own state to control its open/close state.
- Clicking on an accordion item toggles its open/close state, allowing users to expand or collapse the content.
- The content of an open accordion item is rendered below its title when it is expanded, providing users with additional information.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

npm install react-typed

### Continued development

Maybe used for reference.
